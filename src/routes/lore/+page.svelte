<h2>Rasputin</h2>

<div>
    <p>
        Rasputin is 16 at heart and 24 in the head. His parents are from Serbia but he was 
        born and raised in Switzerland. He is now the father of two children and, after 8 
        years as a teacher, has been working for 8 years in the management of a 
        coaching company with the main focus on integrating people with health 
        challenges into the primary labor market. 
        Originally he would have liked to become a footballer, a goalkeeper to be 
        precise, but also tried his hand at studying law and, above all, partied a lot and 
        then traveled the world.

    <p>
        Rasputin has been following crypto since 2017, investing from 2018, then the 
        first larger amount at the peak of 2021. At the beginning of 2022 he really got 
        caught up in the rabbit hole, Bosscats are his first NFTs, he minted Eldridge De 
        Medici and this should then make him today's mfer degen.
        Rasputin is always coming up with new ideas, needs that drive, is a creative 
        thinker but can't draw. He has always strived to keep up with the times and 
        always get everything done at the same moment, but at the same time he likes 
        to be lazy and cannot accept that there are only 24 hours in a day and that 4 
        hours of sleep are not enough in the long run.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rasputin likes to play with words, likes to write while ignoring grammar, speaks 
        6 languages, if you separate German and Swiss German, otherwise he speaks 5 
        and 21 with the help of Deepl. He likes to grasp connections and links new ways 
        of thinking with old ones and especially with common sense. But he 
        communicates in a complicated, often philosophical way. At least that's what 
        he calls it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Rasputin is naive, he believes that there are always simple solutions and that 
        ultimately the good must win. He is convinced that the recipe for peaceful 
        coexistence is very simple.

    <p>
        Rasputin is arrogant, he knows that he offends and provokes, he has the feeling 
        that if he were allowed to speak at the lectern of the Whole World Conference, 
        his words would be understandable to all social groups and could have a 
        positive effect. He believes in the idea of Naive&Arrogant
